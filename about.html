            <h2 class="mb-4">front end developer based in the u.s</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Do you remember MySpace? That was my first encounter with coding. I was changing font sizes and colors, hiding elements on my page, and teaching my friends how to do the same on their pages. I thought I was a hacker! 
                I have always been interested in coding, but growing up, I didn't think that it would be a viable career path for me. I believed I wouldn't be hired because there were no women in that field or so I was told. It wasn't until after 
                covid that I decided to actually give it a go. I was working as a delivery driver. Which is another field dominated by men, and I loved it. But as I started getting older, I realized how taxing it was on my body. In 2020, I set out 
                to find what career would be best for me. Eventually, I signed up for SheCodes.io bootcamp to become a front-end dev. I learned, through tons of practice and real life application, HTML/CSS/JS, responsive, react, and even python for 
                back-end developing. I can honestly say I love coding and I've taken to it like a fish to water. Now Im looking for full-time employment to get my carreer off the ground.
                They say if you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life. That is what I'm after.
